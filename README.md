# Multivariable_Regression_Valuation_Model
Building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
The number of rooms
The distance to employment centres
How rich or poor the area is
How many students there are per teacher in local schools

The project will:
Analyse and explore the Boston house price data in 1970s (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, plotly.express, numpy)
split data for training and testing (sklearn.model_selection - train_test_split)
Run a multivariable regression (sklearn.linear_model - LinearRegression)
Evaluate model's coefficients and residuals
Use data transformation to improve model performance
Use model to estimate a property price based on characteristics
